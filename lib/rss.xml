A directed graph or digraph  is a set  whose members are called vertices, together with a set , whose members are called edges or arcs, and we write .
<br>Note that formally, a directed graph  is just a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Relations" data-href="Relations" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/Relations" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Relation</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Relations" data-href="Relations" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/matematik/discrete-mathematics/relations.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Relation</a> on : This means that results for relations can be applied to digraphs too. For example, a symmetric relation implies that , so all arcs in the graph can be thought of as double pointed.<br>Definition: Directed walk, directed path
A directed walk in a digraph  is a sequence of vertices  such that  for every .
A directed path is a directed walk where all vertices are distinct.
A directed cycle is a directed walk where all vertices are distinct except that .
<br>Definition: Tournament
A tournament is a digraph with exactly one arc between each pair of vertices.
<br>Theorem
In any tournament there is a directed path containing all vertices.
Proof:<br>
We show that any path not containing all vertices can be made longer. Take any path  and suppose  is a vertex not in the path. Then, if  is an edge, we can prepend  and we are done. Otherwise,  is an edge. Then if  is an edge,  can be inserted between  and . Otherwise,  is an edge. Continue this process until either  is inserted, or we reach , meaning  is an edge, meaning  can be appended to the end and we are done.

<br>Definition: Source, sink
Let  be a network.
A source is a vertex  such that all arcs containing  are directed away from .
A sink is a vertex  such that all arcs containing  are directed towards .
<br>We will consider networks where a source and sink exist.<br>Definition: Flow
A flow from the source  to the sink  in a network  is a function  such that for every  where , and where  for every , where  is the capacity function.
<br>Theorem
Let  be a network with a source  and sink , and let  be a flow in . Then Proof:<br>
We have 
<br>Definition: Volume
The volume of a flow  is 
<br>Definition: Cut
Let  be a network and  be a partition of  such that  and . Then  is called a cut, and the capacity of the cut is 
<br>Theorem
If  is a flow from  to  and  is any cut, then Proof:<br>

<br>Theorem
If  is a flow from  to  and  is any cut, then .

<br>Now, suppose that  is a maximum flow and that  is a cut with corresponding minimum capacity. From the theorem above we thus know that<br>

<br>For each edge , if , there is a forward edge  in  with capacity .
<br>For each edge , if , there is a backward edge  in  with capacity .

<br>The residual graph thus shows where additional flow can be added or removed. The forward edges show where additional flow can be introduced without exceeding the capacity, and the backward edges show where flow can be removed without introducing negative flow.<br>Definition: Augmenting path
Let  be a network and  a flow in  with residual graph . An augmenting path is a directed path in  from  to .
<br>A way to maximize flow given a network is now clear; find an augmenting path and introduce more flow along it. Specifically, it is clear that a flow of precisely the minimum capacity along the augmenting path can be introduced. We can show that by repeating this process until no augmenting path exists, always yields a maximum flow.<br>Theorem
Let  be a network. The maximum volume of a flow from  to  is equal to the minimum capacity of a cut separating  and .
Proof:<br>
Let  be a flow in , and let  be its residual graph. If there is an augmenting path in , introduce a flow of precisely the minimum capacity along the augmenting path. Repeat this process until there is no augmenting path.
We are thus left with a flow  in  such that there is no augmenting path. Let  be the vertices reachable by directed paths from  in  (such paths are sometimes called incomplete augmenting paths), and  be the rest of the vertices.

<br>Theorem
Let  be a finite abelian group. Then  is the direct product of its -Sylow subgroups. In other words, if Proof:<br>
The map  given by  is a homomorphism since  is abelian. We first use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="^d2038f" data-href="#^d2038f" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/about:blank#^d2038f" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Lemma</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="^d2038f" data-href="#^d2038f" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/about:blank#^d2038f" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lemma</a> to show that  is injective. Assume  where each . Then there are 's such that , meaning where  are exponents we don't care about since they are multiplying  anyway. Since we also know , we have that  is a common factor of  and , but these are all distinct primes, so  meaning . Hence  is injective. It follows from the sizes of -Sylow groups that the product of the sizes of  is , meaning  is also surjective. So  is indeed an isomorphism between  and .
<br>Furthermore, we can show that each of these subgroups are products of cyclic groups.<br>Lemma
Let  be an abelian -group. Let  be of maximal order. Then there exists a subgroup  such that  is an isomorphism.
Proof:<br>
Since  is a -group, . We induce on . If  then , so the base case holds. Now take any . We know  for some .
Claim 1: For every , .<br>
Proof: We know  for some , implying If  we are done. Otherwise, we can find a  such that . Pick such  of minimal order.
Claim 2: .<br>
Proof: Consider . Since  is of minimal order, . This means  for some . Now we get So . Also,  since , and so  meaning  since we are in a -group. This means , so let . Define . We firstly observe that  since , and secondly we see that . So we conclude that  and by the minimality of  we have .
Now let . Since  is of prime order, we know  is cyclic. Furthermore, we know . To apply the induction hypothesis, we need to find an element of maximal order in . We can show that  is such an element. By Cor. 1.3.13, for every  where , . This means  since if there is some  in , then it generates all of , but . We now get that  since , meaning . But the order is clearly at most , which is the next possible order, so , meaning  indeed has maximal order. 
Now we can apply the induction hypothesis, meaning there exists a subgroup  such that . Now notice that there is a one-to-one correspondence between each  and each . this is true since we can use the canonical projection  and map  and . We now use this to get  meaning  and .
Claim 3: .<br>
Proof: Let . We then get  by the previous paragraph. This in turn means that .
Finally, this means  is injective, meaning

Let  be a graph. An edge colouring of  is a function  such that  for every pair of distinct edges  such that  and  share a vertex.
<br>Theorem
If  is a finite <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Bipartite graphs" data-href="Bipartite graphs" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/Bipartite graphs" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Bipartite graph</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Bipartite graphs" data-href="Bipartite graphs" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/matematik/discrete-mathematics/bipartite-graphs.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bipartite graph</a>, then the minimum number of colours needed for an edge colouring of  is the maximum <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Graphs > ^bb336e" data-href="Graphs#^bb336e" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/Graphs#^bb336e" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Degree</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Graphs > ^bb336e" data-href="Graphs#^bb336e" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/matematik/discrete-mathematics/graphs.html#^bb336e" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Degree</a> of .
Proof:<br>
Clearly an edge colouring is not possible with fewer colours than the maximum degree of , since all edges of the vertex with that degree must have distinct colors. Left to prove is that it is always possible to colour  with that many colours. We induce on . If , then we clearly only need one colour. 
Now take a bipartite graph  with  edges and maximum degree . Take any edge  and consider  with . Clearly  is also a bipartite graph, whose maximum degree is either  or . By our induction hypothesis, we know this can be coloured with at most  colours. Since we removed the edge , we know , meaning there is a colour  in the graph, not used among the edges of , and a colour  in the graph, not used among the edges of . If we can choose  we can give this colour to  and we are done.
Otherwise, we show that we can modify the colouring of  to do this. In this case, we hence know that  has an edge with colour  to a node . Instead, colour that edge , and if  already had an edge with colour , colour that , and if the neighbour already had an edge with colour , colour that , and so on. Since  is finite and bipartite, this process will stop, and we know it will not stop at  since that would imply  has an edge with colour . This now means  no longer has an edge with colour , meaning we can colour  with  and we are done.

A vertex colouring of a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Graphs" data-href="Graphs" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/Graphs" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Graph</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Graphs" data-href="Graphs" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/matematik/discrete-mathematics/graphs.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Graph</a>  is a function  such that  for every adjacent pair of vertices .
The chromatic number  is the least integer  for which there is a vertex colouring of  using  colours.<br>

<br>Equivalently, a vertex colouring is a partition of the vertices such that no two vertices in the same partition are adjacent. A greedy way to find a vertex colouring is to color the first vertex with some color, then for each non-colored vertex, color it with an already used color if possible, otherwise a new color.

A graph  is a pair  where  is a finite set whose members are called vertices and  is a set of -subsets of  whose members are called edges.
<br>Definition: Adjacent, neighbour
Two vertices  and  of a graph  are adjacent or neighbours whenever .
<br>Definition: Isomorphic graphs
Two graphs  and  are isomorphic if there exists a bijection  such that for every . In this case,  is called an isomorphism from  to .
<br>Determining if two graphs are isomorphic is nontrivial, but two graphs can quickly be shown not to be isomorphic if for example they have a different number of vertices or edges.<br>Definition: Degree of vertex
Let  be a graph and . Then and the degree of  is , or in other words, the number of edges containing .
<br>So then of course, the multiset of degree counts of two isomorphic graphs must be the same, meaning this is another fast way of determining that two graphs are not isomorphic.<br>Theorem
Let  be a graph. Then Proof:<br>
Each edge is counted twice; once for each vertex in the edge. In other words, 
<br>Definition: Odd vertex, even vertex
A vertex is odd if its degree is odd, or even if its degree is even.<br>
Given a graph  we define 
<br>This makes  a partition of .<br>Theorem: The number of odd vertices is even
Let  be a graph. Then  is even.
Proof:<br>
We know that both  and  are even, and we also know meaning  must also be even. But it's a sum of odd numbers, meaning it must be a sum of an even number of odd numbers.
<br>Definition: Regular graph
A graph in which all vertices have the same degree  is said to be regular with degree .<br>

In the case of regular graphs, we thus see that .

If no matching of  with greater cardinality than  exists,  is a maximum matching of .
If ,  is called a complete matching or perfect matching of .
<br>Theorem
A bipartite graph  has a complete matching if and only if Hall's condition is satisfied, i.e. for every , where  is the set of neighbours of .
Proof:<br>
: Let  be a complete matching and let . We know each  has a corresponding  such that , and since this  is unique with respect to , we know there are at least  neighbours of .
: The idea is to show that given a matching  where  we can construct a matching  with . Let  be a vertex not matched by . Then we have , so there is a  where  is an edge not in . Now add  to . If  was previously unmatched, we are done. Otherwise, there was an , which we remove from . Then we have , so we can repeat this process for , always reaching unique elements of  and , meaning the process must eventually stop since the graph is finite. Since the process stops once we hit an unmatched , we will have added an edge to , meaning .
<br>Definition: Alternating path
Let  be a bipartite graph and  be a matching of . Then the path  is an alternating path for  if the edges  are in  but the edges  are not in , for all , and  and  do not belong to any edge of .
<br>Definition: Deficiency
The deficiency of a bipartite graph  is 
<br>Note that  since we can choose . This means Hall's condition is equivalent to .<br>Theorem
The size of a maximum matching  in a bipartite graph  is Proof:<br>
Let  such that . This means that for any matching, at least  elements of  are unmatched, so . Remains to show that such a matching exists. Let  be a set of  elements and let  where , , and  where  is the set of all edges between  and . Then we have  meaning by the definition of . This means  satisfies Hall's condition, meaning  has a complete matching . Now we can remove the  edges from  which have a vertex in , and obtain a matching of size .
<br>Theorem
If a matching  in a bipartite graph  is not a maximum matching, then  contains an alternating path for .
Proof:<br>
Let  be a maximum matching, and let  be the set of edges which are in  or  but not in both. Then the graph with edges  and vertices of the edges of  is a graph where each vertex has either degree  or , meaning the components of it are paths or cycles. For any cycle, precisely every second edge must be in , since both  and  are matchings, meaning if all components are cycles, then , which is not true, so there must be at least one component which is a path of odd number of edges, and this must be an alternating path of .
<br>This proof gives a strategy to find a maximum matching.<br>Method: Finding a maximum matching

<br>Start with any matching  with at least one edge.
<br>Search for an alternating path for .
<br>If an alternating path is found, construct a larger matching  by "inverting" the alternating path, i.e. adding every edge of the path that was not in , and removing the ones that were. Then repeat from 2.
<br>If no alternating path can be found, we are done.

<br>Method: Finding an alternating path
The brute force way is to choose an unmatched vertex  and see if there is an alternating path starting with  by just trying everything recursively.

<br>Definition: Conjugate permutations
Let . If there exists a permutation  such that  we say that  and  are conjugate.
<br>Theorem
Let . Then  and  are conjugate if and only if they have the same type.
Proof:<br>
: Let  such that . We see that , meaning any -cycle of  has a corresponding -cycle of  which is just the image of  on the cycle.<br>
: We want to construct a  such that . For each subset  on which  is a -cycle there is a corresponding  on which  is a -cycle. Let  and . Then define  for every . We then get that We see then that  on  is a bijection to , so when this is done for every  and corresponding , we get a bijection  which satisfies .
<br>Definition: Transposition
A transposition is a permutation which only interchanges two elements, meaning it has only one -cycle and the rest -cycles.
<br>We quickly see that any cycle can be written as a composition of transpositions, for example, . Since any permutation is the composition of cycles, any permutation is the composition of transpositions.<br>Notation
For any  we denote the number of cycles of  by .
<br>Lemma
For any  and transposition ,  is either  or .
Proof:<br>
We have two cases: either  transposes elements in a single cycle of , or elements in different cycles of . In the first case, suppose we have a transposition of  and , meaning we have since  and , meaning . In the second case, suppose we have a transposition of  and , meaning we have since  and , meaning .
<br>Theorem
Let  be the composition of  transpositions and also the composition of  compositions. Then  and  have the same parity.

<br>Definition: Even permutation, odd permutation
A permutation is even if it is the composition of an even number of transpositions, otherwise odd.
The sign of a permutation , denoted , is  if it is odd, otherwise .
<br>We notice that if  can be written as  transpositions and  can be written as  transpositions, then .<br>Theorem
For any integer  exactly half of the permutations in  are even and exactly half of them are odd.
Proof:<br>
Let  be all unique even permutations of . Then take any transposition . We see that  are all odd, and that if , then , so they are all unique. Now for any odd  we know  is even, meaning  for some , meaning , but  so  meaning every odd permutation is among .

Consider the conjugation action  of a finite group  and let  be a system of representatives of the orbits contained in  (where '' denotes setminus). Then Proof:<br>
The point of the theorem is that  can be partitioned into its conjugacy classes, which are the equivalence classes with conjugacy as equivalence relation. We know each element in  has only itself as conjugacy class, since every conjugation does nothing. Hence instead of writing out  for every element in  we combine them into just .

Each possible sequence of sets  can be done by choosing a permutation of all elements of  and then letting  contain the first  elements,  contain the following  elements, and so on. There are  ways of doing this, but each possible partition is then counted  times since that's the number of ways to order the elements and still preserving the sets .

For any  and , where the sum is over all possible  such that .
Proof:<br>
We consider a multiset of  copies of , and we are thus interested in the product of these elements, and we see that every term in the result is of the form  where , and that the coefficient for that term is the number of ways to choose exactly one term from  from each factor such that in total, the number of  chosen is precisely , which we see corresponds to the definition of the multinomial number.

A partition of a set  is a family  of nonempty sets such that  is the disjoint union of all sets in . Each  is called a part of the partition.

Let . When , the only possible partition is , and when , the only possible partition is , since sets in the partition must be nonempty. Finally, when , we have two cases for a partition:  is in its own set, or  is not in its own set. If  is in its own set, the remaining elements must be partitioned into  sets, which there are  ways of doing. If  is not in its own set, it must belong to a set in a -partition of the remaining  items, which there are  ways of doing, and since for each such way there are  sets to which  can belong, we multiply this by  and arive at the formula.

 <br><a href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar?query=tag:matematik-discmath" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#matematik-discmath</a> <br>Definition: Statement
A statement is a declarative sentence that is either true, denoted by  or false, denoted by .
<br>Definition: Logical operations
For any statements , we define the following statements:

<br> pronounced "not " is  if , otherwise .
<br> pronounced " and " is  if both  and , otherwise .
<br> pronounced " or " is  if either  or , otherwise .
<br> pronounced " implies " is  if  and not , otherwise .
<br> pronounced " if and only if " is  if either both  and , or neither  nor , otherwise . If , we call  and  logically equivalent.

<br>The definition of  deserves a small discussion. This definition feels weird since we are not used to " implies " being a logical statement in the same sense as " and ", but of course, it is either true or false, so it is a logical statement. What we need to keep in mind is that we are often not interested in knowing if , but rather in proving . So we often know that the statement  is true, without knowing whether  or  are true. Then if we succeed in proving , we also know .<br>Remark
We can define  
<br>Theorem: Contrapositive
For any two statements , Proof:<br>
We have 
<br>So proving that  can be done by proving that , which is often useful.

För att notationen inte ska bli alltför överflödig betraktar vi en bilinjär avbildning . Ibland vore det bra om vi kunde "göra om" denna bilinjära avbildning till en linjär avbildning, eftersom det ändå är linjära avbildningar vi studerar i linjär algebra.<br>Vår strategi blir att införa ett nytt vektorrum som vi kallar , som vi vill använda som "mellanhand" mellan  och . När vi genom en bilinjär avbildning  går från  till  vill vi alltså istället gå från  till , och sedan från  till . Vi säger att avbildningen från  till  kallas  och är bilinjär, och att avbildningen från  till  kallas  och är <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Linjära avbildningar" data-href="Linjära avbildningar" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/Linjära avbildningar" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Linjär</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Linjära avbildningar" data-href="Linjära avbildningar" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/matematik/linjär-algebra/linjära-avbildningar.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Linjär</a>.<br><br>Men då känns det ju faktiskt som att vi inte kommit någonstans alls; vi har bara delat upp vår bilinjära avbildning  i en bilinjär  och en linjär ! Men det speciella är att genom att välja vektorrummet  och den bilinjära avbildningen  på rätt sätt, kan vi se till att  och  fungerar som mellanhand för alla ! I den meningen har vi alltså överfört en bilinjär avbildning på en linjär, eftersom det enda som beror av den bilinjära avbildningen  är den linjära avbildningen . Vi lägger även till kravet att  ska vara unik givet , så att varje bilinjära avbildning överförs på en unik linjär avbildning. Vi kallar vektorrummet  tillsammans med den bilinjära avbildningen  för en tensorprodukt av  och .<br>Anmärkning
Begreppet tensorprodukt används ganska slarvigt, men refererar alltså i sin tydligaste mening till vektorrummet  tillsammans med den bilinjära avbildningen . Notera här att symbolen  i  inte är den bilinjära avbildningen , utan  betraktas bäst bara som en symbol för ett vektorrum. För att vara tydlig kan vi alltså skriva en tensorprodukt av  och  som . Begreppet refererar dock ofta till endast vektorrummet , eller till en vektor  i .
<br>Men hur väljer vi då  och  "på rätt sätt"? Det är inte uppenbart, men vi behöver inte ge en entydig definition av vad vektorrummet  och den bilinjära avbildningen  är, utan vi kan nöja oss med att ge en rad krav för att ett visst vektorrum och bilinjär avbildning utgör en tensorprodukt av  och .<br>Definition: Tensorprodukt
Tensorprodukten av två vektorrum  och  är ett vektorrum  tillsammans med en bilinjär avbildning , så att det för alla vektorrum  och alla bilinjära avbildningar  finns en unik linjär avbildning  sådan att , det vill sägaför alla  och .
<br>Denna definition kallas för den universella egenskapen för tensorprodukten, och är ett av flera sätt att definiera tensorprodukten. Vi säger alltså inte explicit vad  och  är för något, utan endast att det är ett vektorrum och bilinjär avbildning som uppfyller vissa krav.<br>Ett skäl till att vi lägger till kravet att  ska vara unik är för att se till att  är precis så stort det behöver vara för sitt syfte, nämligen att överföra bilinjära avbildningar på linjära. Vi kan förtydliga detta med en sats.<br>Sats:  spänner upp .
Om  och  är vektorrum och  är en tensorprodukt av  och  så är<br>

Bevis:<br>
Antag att  och att . Då kan vi välja ett vektorrum  med fler än en vektor, samt en bilinjär avbildning . Eftersom  är en tensorprodukt finns då ett unikt linjärt  så att  för alla , men eftersom  så sätter detta inte ett krav på . Vi kan alltså genom  avbilda  på godtycklig vektor i , så då är inte  unikt bestämd, vilket motsäger definitionen.
<br>Men för att gå tillbaka till definitionen finns ju alltså flera möjliga vektorrum som vi får kalla . Det kanske känns förvirrande, men just att definitionen är en universell egenskap är viktigt. Den säger nämligen att alla möjliga vektorrum som uppfyller definitionen är isomorfa med unik isomorfi. Det betyder att det givet två möjliga sådana vektorrum finns ett unikt sätt att para ihop alla vektorer i vektorrummen med varandra, alltså kan vi se alla dessa möjliga tensorprodukter av  och  som samma, bara att vi har bytt namn på varje vektor. Vi sammanfattar detta i en sats.<br>Sats: Tensorprodukten är unik upp till unik isomorfi
Om  samt  är möjliga tensorprodukter av  och  så finns en unik isomorfi mellan  och .
Bevis:<br>
Enligt definitionen finns unika linjära avbildningar  och  sådana att vilket ger attoch då måste  och  vara identiteterna på  respektive . Eftersom de är linjära och  och  enligt tidigare spänner upp  respektive  måste de även vara identiteterna på  respektive , alltså är  en isomorfi mellan  och . Eftersom de är unikt bestämda måste även isomorfin vara unikt bestämd.
<br>Detta visar alltså att vår ursprungliga definition faktiskt är en universell egenskap, och säger att alla möjliga tensorprodukter mellan  och  kan ses som samma eftersom skillnaden helt enkelt kan ses som ett namnbyte av varje vektor.<br>Men vi har ju dock aldrig visat att tensorprodukter finns; vi kanske gav en definition som är omöjlig att uppfylla. Som tur är ska det visa sig att så inte är fallet. Vi börjar med att titta på vad som händer när vi inför baser till  och .<br>Sats: Tensorprodukt med baser
Låt  och  vara baser för  respektive . Låt även  vara ett vektorrum och  vara en bilinjär avbildning. Då är  en tensorprodukt av  och  om och endast om  är en bas för .
Bevis:<br>
Vi börjar med att visa . Antag alltså att  är en tensorprodukt av  och . Givet  och  finns tal så att  och . Det ger att alltså spänner  upp  vilket spänner upp . För att visa linjärt oberoende utnyttjar vi att, som vi precis sett, en bilinjär avbildning  bestäms unikt av alla . Vi kan därmed välja  och  så att alla  är linjärt oberoende, vilket ger att den motsvarande linjära avbildningen  uppfyller att alla  är linjärt oberoende, vilket ger att alla  är linjärt oberoende. Därmed är  en bas.
Vi visar nu . Antag alltså att  är en bas för . Givet en bilinjär avbildning  vet vi då att den motsvarande linjära avbildningen  unikt måste bestämmas av att<br>

<br>Det kan vara lite svårt att från denna definition få en bra bild av vad som sägs, så vi tar ett exempel. <br>Exempel
Om vi betraktar -tensorer  till något -dimensionellt vektorrum  så kan ju de beskrivas med en uppsättning tal  enligt<br>
 Om vi ordnar talen  i en matris så är tensorn symmetrisk om och endast om  är symmetrisk, och tensorn är alternerande om och endast om  är antisymmetrisk. Vi ser det eftersom den enda (icke-identitet) permutationen av  element är att byta plats på elementen, så för att tensorn ska vara symmetrisk ska alltså  och för att den ska vara alternerande så ska .
<br>För att få en bättre bild av vad som händer när vi går till tensorer av högre ordning än 2 kan vi betrakta dimensionerna av rummen av symmetriska respektive alternerande tensorer.<br>Sats: , 
Om  är ett vektorrum så är<br>
Bevis:<br>
För att hitta dimensionen av alla symmetriska -tensorer undrar vi alltså hur många linjärt oberoende uppsättningar tal  som finns sådana att motsvarande tensor är symmetrisk. Det är då antalet uppsättningar index  som inte är permutationer av varandra, vilket är samma som antalet sätt att välja  element från  stycken, eftersom vi kan se det som att placera ut  stycken "separerare" bland dessa  element (klassiskt kombinatoriktänk).
För alternerande -tensorer gör vi på samma sätt men måste tänka på att vi nu inte får ha något ; alla sådana  är  eftersom vi kan byta plats på  och  vilket ger att . Alltså blir antalet uppsättningar index  som vi får välja  fritt till helt enkelt antalet sätt att välja  element från , alltså .

En Markovkedja är en slags stokastisk process som vid varje tidpunkt  befinner sig i ett av ett ändligt antal möjliga tillstånd, och där sannolikheten att vid en viss tidpunkt befinna sig i ett visst tillstånd endast beror på tillståndet i föregående tidpunkt.
<br>En Markovkedja med  stycken möjliga tillstånd bestäms alltså unikt av sannolikheterna att gå från tillstånd  till tillstånd  för alla . Vi kan ordna dessa sannolikheter i en kvadratisk matris som vi kallar för en sannolikhetsmatris. I en sådan matris beskriver alltså kolumn  sannolikheterna att gå till de olika möjliga tillstånden om det aktuella tillståndet är tillstånd . <br>Definition: Sannolikhetsvektor, sannolikhetsmatris

Vi ser dock att vi inte alltid kommer gå mot ett stationärt tillstånd, eftersom vi kan bilda en Markovkedja och välja ett utgångsläge så att den med hundra procents sannolikhet går i en bestämd cykel mellan flera tillstånd. Däremot kan vi visa att det åtminstone alltid finns ett stationärt tillstånd.<br>Lemma

<br>Definition: Reguljär sannolikhetsmatris
En sannolikhetsmatris  kallas reguljär om det finns ett  sådant att  är positiv, alltså sådant att varje element i  är positivt.
<br>En tolkning av vad som menas med en Markovkedja som beskrivs av en reguljär sannolikhetsmatris är att det finns en tidpunkt där kedjan oavsett utgångsläge kan vara i vilket tillstånd som helst. Detta eftersom vi efter att ha applicerat en positiv sannolikhetsmatris på en sannolikhetsvektor får en positiv sannolikhetsvektor, vilket betyder att vi kan vara varsomhelst.<br>Vi ser direkt från dessa definitioner att alla reguljära sannolikhetsmatriser också är irreducibla.<br>Sats
Om  är en irreducibel sannolikhetsmatris så gäller

<br>Om  är en egenvektor med egenvärde  där  så är samtliga koordinater i  nollskilda.
<br>Det finns en positiv sannolikhetsvektor som är en egenvektor med egenvärde .

<br>Anmärkning
Även  räknas ibland som ett singulärvärde, och alla  och  kallas då högersingulära respektive vänstersingulära. Vi får dock inte de entydiga paren av en vänstersingulär och högersingulär vektor som vi får med positiva singulärvärden.

En kropp är en mängd  tillsammans med två binära operationer  och  som har åtminstone två element  och , med egenskaperna

<br>Associativitet:  och 
<br>Kommutativitet:  och 
<br>Identiteter:  och 
<br>Inverser: finns ett  s.a. , och om  så finns ett  så att .
<br>Distributivitet: 

för alla .
<br>Definition: Delkropp
En delkropp av en kropp  är en delmängd  där , , ,  för alla , och  för alla .
<br>Sats: Kropp är vektorrum över delkropp
Om  är en kropp och  är en delkropp, så är  ett vektorrum över .
Bevis:<br>
Addition av tal i  samt multiplikation med tal i  är väldefinierat och uppfyller samma regler som de för ett vektorrum.
<br>Definition: Isomorfi av kroppar
Om  är kroppar så är en isomorfi mellan  och  en bijektion  som respekterar addition, multiplikation och enheter, det vill säga , ,  och .
<br>Notera att det från denna definition följer att en isomorfi  även respekterar inverser, så att  och .<br>Definition: 
För alla heltal  så är  restklasserna i  vid division med  med addition och multiplikation som ges av 
<br>Sats:  kropp om  primtal
Om  är ett primtal så är  en kropp med  element.
Bevis:<br>
Heltalen uppfyller redan alla egenskaper förutom existensen av en multiplikativ invers. Det följer att även heltalen modulo  uppfyller dessa krav. Kvar är att visa att även multiplikativa inverser finns för nollskilda . Vi noterar att om  så är , och eftersom  så är alltså , så . Därmed är multiplikation med  injektivt, och eftersom  är ändlig är alltså multiplikation med  även surjektivt, alltså finns en multiplikativ invers.
<br>Sats: Minsta delkropp är  eller  för något primtal 
Om  är en kropp där  så finns en minsta delkropp  som är snittet av alla delkropp i . Då är  isomorf med antingen  eller .
Bevis:<br>
Vi vet att  och därmed även . Om detta ger oändligt många element så finns alla heltal och därmed alla rationella tal i , och då är . Annars finns ett minsta  s.a. . Det måste vara ett primtal eftersom om  så är  vilket ger att antingen  eller , men det motsäger att  är minst.
<br>Definition: Primkropp
Den minsta delkroppen av en kropp  kallas för primkroppen i .
<br>Sats: En ändlig kropp har  element
Om  är en ändlig kropp så har  exakt  stycken element för något primtal  och heltal .
Bevis:<br>
Primkroppen  i  har ett primtal  element, och  är ett vektorrum över  och är därför isomorf med  för något , som har  stycken element.
<br>Definition: Karakteristik
Om primkroppen till en kropp  är  så har  karakteristik . Om primkroppen är  så har  karakteristik .
<br>Sats: 
Om en kropp  har karakteristik  så är  för alla .
Bevis:<br>
I binomialutvecklingen blir varje term förutom den första och sista delbar med  eftersom  och  är delbart med  medan varken  eller  är det om .
<br>Från detta följer både Fermats lilla sats, som säger att , och från det även Eulers sats, som säger att , vilket fås från att helt enkelt dividera med  i Fermats lilla sats, om .<br>Sats: Ändliga kroppar kan representeras av matriser
Alla ändliga kroppar går att representera med en mängd matriser och med multiplikation och addition definierat som vanligt för matriser.
Bevis:<br>
Låt  vara en ändlig kropp med primkroppen . Det finns då en bas  för  som vektorrum över . För alla  finns då en matris  m.a.p basen  som motsvarar multiplikation med , som är linjärt. Då beter sig dessa matriser precis som elementen i  eftersom matrisen för  blir  och matrisen för  blir . Mängden av alla  är därmed en kropp isomorf med .
<br>Definition: Irreducibelt polynom
Ett polynom  kallas irreducibelt om det inte kan skrivas som en produkt av två polynom i  av lägre grad.
<br>Sats: Konstruktion av kropp
Om  är en matris i  och <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Minimalpolynom" data-href="Minimalpolynom" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/Minimalpolynom" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Minimalpolynomet</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Minimalpolynom" data-href="Minimalpolynom" href="https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/matematik/linjär-algebra/minimalpolynom.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Minimalpolynomet</a>  till  är irreducibelt så är en kropp med addition och multiplikation av matriser som operationer.
Bevis:<br>
Vi vet redan att  är ett vektorrum över . Låt . Då är  en bas för . Vi ser även att multiplikation i  är kommutativt eftersom  och  kommuterar för alla . Kvar att visa är då att multiplikativa inverser finns. Antag att ett nollskilt element i  inte är inverterbart. Elementet kan skrivas som  där  eftersom om  så är elementet en multipel av identitetsmatrisen, som är inverterbar. Med polynomdivision får vi då att  där  inte är nollpolynomet eftersom  är irreducibelt. Vi vet då att , alltså är , alltså är  inverterbar eftersom det är en multipel av identitetsmatrisen. Därmed får vi  alltså är  inverterbar för alla , och därmed är  en kropp.

Vi kan se direkta summor som att bilda ett nytt vektorrum vars vektorer är par av vektorer från  respektive , där vi utför addition och skalärmultiplikation komponentvis.<br>Definition: Yttre direkt summa
Den yttre direkta summan av två vektorrum  och  är ett vektorrum  s.a.<br>
där  för alla ,  och . 
<br>Om  och  är delrum till något gemensamt vektorrum  så är addition  där  och  definierat. Vi inför då även summan  av delrummen.<br>Definition: Summa av delrum
Summan av två delrum  och  av ett gemensamt vektorrum  är ett delrum  s.a.<br>

<br>Om nu  och  är delrum sådana att varje vektor  kan skrivas på ett unikt sätt som  för något  och  så kan vi se det som att varje vektor i  innehåller informationen av en vektor i  och en vektor i . Detta liknar den yttre direkta summan  väldigt mycket, och vi kallar då summan  för en inre direkt summa eller bara direkt summa och skriver  även för att beteckna den inre direkta summan.<br>Definition: Inre direkt summa
Om  och  är delrum av ett gemensamt vektorrum  och om varje vektor  kan skrivas på ett unikt sätt som  för något  och  så kallar vi summan för en inre direkt summa och skriver  för att indikera att summan är direkt.
<br>Anmärkning:  kan beteckna antingen inre eller yttre direkt summa
När  skrivs är det alltså inte alltid viktigt om det är en yttre eller inre direkt summa som avses, eftersom dessa i någon mening innehåller precis samma information, och därför kan ses som samma sak. Om däremot  och  inte är delrum av något gemensamt vektorrum så avses alltid den yttre direkta summan.
<br>Med definitionen vi givit nu är det inte uppenbart hur vi avgör om  är en direkt summa eller inte. Som tur är finns ett lätt sätt att kontrollera det.<br>Sats:  direkt  
Om  och  är delrum av ett gemensamt vektorrum  så är  en direkt summa om och endast om .

Vi visar först . Antag alltså att  är en direkt summa, och antag att . Då är , alltså är  som en summa av en vektor i  och en i . Eftersom  alltid uppfyller detta och denna summa ska vara unik måste alltså , alltså är .
Nu visar vi . Antag alltså att , och antag att  för några  och . Då är , vilket implicerar att  eftersom de är additiva inverser av varandra. Detta ger att , alltså är  och  vilket ger att alla  är unikt bestämda som en summa .
<br>Nu tillbaka till världen där vi betraktar den inre och yttre direkta summan som samma sak. I följande sats används den yttre direkta summan i beviset, men satsen gäller alltså för både yttre on inre direkta summor.<br>Sats:

<br>Denna definition kräver dessa jobbiga kvoter eftersom, för det första, när vi tar vektorrummet av kontinuerliga funktioner så finns följder av funktioner vars gränsvärde inte är en kontinuerlig funktion; till exempel kan man tänka sig en följd av funktioner där lutningen i någon punkt ökar och går mot , så att gränsvärdesfunktionen har ett hopp i den punkten. För det andra, när vi även tagit med dessa gränsvärdesfunktioner så har vi inte längre en inre produkt eftersom det finns gränsvärdesfunktioner som är nollskild på en nollmängd och därmed har norm  men inte är noll, vilket bryter mot kravet att inre produkten är positivt definit.

För att få med det här slags fallet måste vi alltså bredda vår bild av vad som menas med att en operator "i någon mening" är noll.

<br>Uppenbarligen är nilpotenta operatorer  inte inverterbara eftersom  då också hade varit inverterbar.

Om  är linjära och diagonaliserbara samt har en gemensam egenbas så kallas de samtidigt diagonaliserbara.
<br>Med denna definition låter det svårt att avgöra huruvida två operatorer är samtidigt diagonaliserbara, men som tur är finns ett enkelt kriterium.<br>Sats: Samtidigt diagonaliserbara  diagonaliserbara och kommuterar

Om istället  vet vi först att det finns egenrum  till  så att<br>

Vi vet att alla baser till  som är unioner av baser till varje  är en egenbas till , så om varje restriktion av  till  är diagonaliserbar kan vi för varje  välja en bas till  av egenvektorer till , vilket skapar en gemensam egenbas till  och .

Men vi ger ändå yttre potenser en egen definition utifrån dess universella egenskap, som liknar tensorproduktens universella egenskap väldigt mycket.<br>Definition: Yttre potensen 
En yttre potensen av grad  av ett vektorrum  är ett vektorrum  tillsammans med en alternerande -multilinjär avbildning , så att det för alla vektorrum  och alla alternerande -multilinjära avbildningar  finns en unik linjär avbildning  sådan att , det vill sägaför alla .

<br>Nu kan vi precis som med tensorer införa en bas till  för att dels visa existens och dels för att göra livet lättare. Beviset liknar återigen motsvarigheten för tensorer en del, men vi skriver ut det ändå.<br>Sats: Yttre potens med bas
Låt  vara en bas för , låt  vara ett vektorrum och låt  vara -multilinjär och alternerande. Då är  en yttre potens av grad  av  om och endast om<br>
är en bas för .
Bevis:<br>
Vi börjar med att visa . Antag alltså att  är en yttre potens av grad  av . Givet  finns då tal  och  så att<br>
alltså spänner alla  upp . Däremot är dessa inte linjärt oberoende eftersom  är alternerande. Vi vet att vi kan sortera index  med ett ändligt antal platsbyten, alltså skiljer alla permuteringar varandra av som mest ett teckenbyte. Därmed spänner  upp alla , vilket alltså spänner upp . För att visa linjärt oberoende utnyttjar vi att en alternerande -multilinjär avbildning  bestäms entydigt av alla  för alla . Vi kan därmed välja  och  så att alla  är linjärt oberoende. Det ger att alla  är linjärt oberoende, vilket medför att alla  är linjärt oberoende, alltså är  en bas för .
Vi visar nu . Antag alltså att  är en bas för . Givet en alternerande -multilinjär avbildning  vet vi då att den motsvarande linjära avbildningen  unikt måste bestämmas av att<br>
för alla . Då gäller att<br>
för alla , alltså är  och  är unikt bestämd, så mycket riktigt är  en yttre potens av grad  av .
<br>Från detta följer att om  är ändligdimensionellt så är<br>
eftersom det är så många olika uppsättningar index  som finns.]]></description><link>https://samdooo.github.io/Anteckningar/matematik/linjär-algebra/yttre-potenser.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Matematik/Linjär algebra/Yttre potenser.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Samdooo]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2024 12:51:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
